Games Tested

Borderlands 2 - Working
	Issues:

Dead Island - Given Up
	Why
	1. Steam won't let me open 2 instances. 
	2. The crack won't let me open 2 instances.
	3. The game probably will conflict if open twice.

	Why Could be:
	1. Monitor Profile is text file, easy to modify


Gears of War - Not tested
	Why
	1. Don't have game, neither money to buy

Saints Row 3 - Given up
	Why: 
	1. Steam won't let me open 2 instances. 
	2. The SKIDROW crack won't let us open 2 instances of Saints Row 3. 
	3. Would need to combine Skidrow with a INJECTOR on the Saints Row executable, 
	   making it think it's not running a secondary format. 
	3. Saints Row's save format is BINARY.
	4. The profile (which probably contains the resolution) is not described on the internet,
	   so I'd need to reverse engineer it (something I really don't like).
