# Nucleus Co-Op
Nucles Co-Op is a tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it.

Support its development by helping on my Patreon! https://www.patreon.com/distro

Currently Supported Games:
(only games I've personally tested)

- Borderlands 2
- Borderlands: The Pre Sequel


So close but not there yet:

- Borderlands
	Working: All instances open correctly using SmartSteamEmu, can even join LAN games.
	Issue: Can't control 2 screens at once. Need to find a way to fake focus (-AlwaysFocus doesn't work on this game)
- Saints Row 3
	Working: All instances open correctly using SmartSteamEmu, can control all instances freely
	Issue: Can't find the game on LAN. If from the Shift + Tab menu, the game says the session is no longer available.


Working on:

- Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Zombies
- Gears of War


Next on the List:

- Left 4 Dead 1
- Left 4 Dead 2
- Portal 2
- Call of Duty: Black Ops
- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
- Saints Row 3
- Saints Row 4
- Team Fortress 2 (support for 64 players on 1 machine FTW)
- Unlimited Power mode (multiple keyboards + mouses + gamepads)


Games I want to add but I don't own:

- Call of Duty: World At War
- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3




A ton of games will be supported thank for the godsend tool called SmartSteamEmu, developed by syahmixp,  grabbed from http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=62935 
Awesome application that emulates Steam and even enables LAN connections, so we can play everything easily!
