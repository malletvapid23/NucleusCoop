# Nucleus Co-Op
Nucles Co-Op is a tool for Windows that allows split-screen play on many games that do not initially support it.

Working on:

- Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Zombies


Next on the List:

- The games that were working before
- Call of Duty: Black Ops
- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2
- Saints Row 3
- Saints Row 4
- Team Fortress 2 (support for 64 players on 1 machine FTW)


Games I want to add but I don't own:

- Call of Duty: World At War
- Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3




A ton of games will be supported thank for the godsend tool called SmartSteamEmu, developed by syahmixp,  grabbed from http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=62935 
Awesome application that emulates Steam and even enables LAN connections, so we can play everything easily!
