Use of parameters is separated by a | character. So it would look something like this [ "filename.ini|\\bin|1,2" ]. This example would copy filename.ini from Nucleus\utils\User to Instance0\bin and Instance1\bin. If you don't specify which instances, it will do them all by default.

3. New methods to be used in game scripts -

Context.ChangeXmlNodeInnerTextValue(string path, string nodeName, string newValue)		//Edit an XML element (previously only nodes and attributes)
Context.ReplaceLinesInTextFile(string path, string[] lineNumAndnewValues)			//Replace an entire line; for string array use the format: "lineNum|newValue", the | is required
Context.ReplacePartialLinesInTextFile(string path, string[] lineNumRegPtrnAndNewValues)		//Partially replace a line; for string array use the format: "lineNum|Regex pattern|newValue", the | is required
Context.RemoveLineInTextFile(string path, int lineNum)						//Removes a given line number completely
Context.RemoveLineInTextFile(string path, string txtInLine, SearchType type)			//Removes a given line number completely
Context.FindLineNumberInTextFile(string path, string searchValue, SearchType type)		//Returns a line number (int), utilizes a newly created enum SearchType
	Each of the above methods, also have an overload method so you can specify a kind of encoding to use (enter string of encoding as last parameter, e.g. "utf-8", "utf-16", "us-ascii")
	- SearchTypes include: "Contains", "Full" and "StartsWith", use like so: Nucleus.SearchType.StartsWith
Context.CreateRegKey(string baseKey, string sKey, string subKey)				//Create a registry key for current user, baseKey can either be "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" or "HKEY_CURRENT_USER"
Context.DeleteRegKey(string baseKey, string sKey, string subKey)				//Delete a registry key for current user, baseKey can either be "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" or "HKEY_CURRENT_USER"
Context.EditRegKey(string baseKey, string sKey, string name, object data, RegType type)	//Edit a registry key for current user, baseKey can either be "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" or "HKEY_CURRENT_USER"
	EditRegKey uses a custom registry data type to use, by using Nucleus.RegType.DWord for example. The last word can be of the same name of RegistryValueKind enum.
Context.Nickname										//Use this in a game script to get the player's nickname
Context.GamepadGuid										//Get the raw gamepad guid

v0.9.6.0a - September 20, 2019
- Added an option in game scripts to rename mutexes instead of killing them
- Tweaked method of finding mutexes to be more inclusive. You can now provide a partial name of mutex to kill (you must still provide full name for renaming)
- Upgraded custom xinput dll to Alpha 10s' and added x64 custom dll support (alpha 10 custom dlls are now the default, but you can revert back to alpha 8 with a line in game script for compatability)
- Added 6 and 8 player support
- Added an option to delete games from directly within the NucleusCoop UI
- Added the ability to assign "nicknames" to controllers in settings, used to identify specific controllers
- Added the option to allow you to use those newly created nicknames in-game, instead of default "Player1", "Player2" etc (this is for games using Goldberg only)
- Added the ability to see which controller is which by simply holding down a button on a controller. The corresponding controller icon will light up
- Added an option in game scripts to keep the game's aspect ratio when resizing
- Added an option in game scripts to manually set width, height, as well as position of each game window
- Added an option in game scripts to launch and set up x360ce before launching games (make sure you aren't using custom dlls)
- Added an option in game scripts to have the user decide when to open the next instance, instead of each being opened automatically
- Added an option in game scripts to hide desktop background
- Added an option in game scripts to hide taskbar when launching games
- Added an option in game scripts to hide the mouse cursor
- Added an option in game scripts to add the process ID to the end of game windows (helpful for creating unique/different window titles)
- Added an option in game scripts to use different exe names for each instance
- Added an option in game scripts to Hardcopy game files instead of Symlinking
- Added an option in game scripts to resize and reposition the previous window after a new window opens (some games need this)
- Fixed a bug preventing x64 focus and setwindow hooks from working
- Fixed a bug preventing Nucleus from opening when multiple scripts use the same Game.ExecutableName value
- WIP: rudimentary support for DInput alongside XInput (more recognized in Nucleus, can be assigned to a screen like any instance - should work in game). *Most dinput devices will still need to be set up manually.
- WIP: rudimentary Keyboard support

v0.9.5.3a - August 30, 2019
- Fixed a bug that stopped Game.FakeFocus from working

v0.9.5.2a - August 30, 2019
- Fixed Halo not working correctly with more than 2 instances

v0.9.5.1a - August 29, 2019
- Added an option in game scripts to prevent games from resizing on their own
- Added an option in game scripts to copy files from the game directory to the instanced folder
- Added a parameter to the registry manipulation methods, you can now specify a base key to work from (local machine or current user)
- Created a custom solution in order for Halo Custom Edition to work in Nucleus
- Tweaked EditRegKey so it now takes an object data type as the data and a custom RegType to specify the registry type (DWord, QWord, Binary, etc), opens alot more possibilities
- Reworked launching games using command prompt, much better results now. CMDOptions can now be specified per game instance (first instance is ignored for now)
- Fixed an issue with focus hooks that would sometimes crash the game
- Fixed launching games that don't require mutexes be killed but still have initial hooks
- Fixed some other minor bugs

v0.9.5 - August 21, 2019
- Added an option in game scripts to hook into game functions to trick the game into thinking it has focus
- Added an option in game scripts to hook into game functions that try and prevent multiple instances from running
- Added @gymmer's "FocusFaker' method to further trick the game into thinking it has focus
- Added an option in game scripts to set the window priority of each game instance. Can be set to either "AboveNormal", "High" or "RealTime"
- Added an option in game scripts to assign which processor games run on. Can be either an ideal processor (safer, no gaurantee) or a fixed one despite availability
- Added the ability to edit registry keys. Required for some games
- Added an option in game scripts to work-around ForceFocusWindowName having to match 1:1 with game window title for resizing, positioning and focus. Needed for some games that change their window title (does not effect game launchers)
- Added an option to force the title of game windows to be whatever is specific in Game.Hook.ForceFocusWindowName
- Added an option to specify individual files to Symlink
- Added an option in game scripts to launch a game using cmd with specified options

- You can now customize the Nucleus hotkeys to be whatever you'd like
- Fixed a bug that Nucleus did not work properly when game windows were closed manually
- Updated method to toggle game windows being top most. It is now more efficient and doesn't rely on game script
- Minor improvement in performance
- Cleaned up some code

v0.9.4.1a - August 7, 2019
- Fixed bug that broke the generic file manipulation methods

v0.9.4a - August 6, 2019
- Added two new methods for game scripts: RemoveLineInTextFile and FindLineNumberInTextFile
- All four of the generic file manipulation methods (Find, Remove, Replace, ReplacePartial) now include an overload method to specify the kind of encoding to use
- Added a new variable to be used in Remove & Find Line methods: Nucleus.SearchType. You can specify either "Contains", "Full" or "StartsWith" to get more accurate results. Now with the four file manipulation methods, you should now be able to edit ANY game text file for ANY game
- Fixed bug in original Nucleus that didn't allow 1 player to be able to start/play a game
- Fixed "one time use" bug in original Nucleus; Nucleus can now be used multiple times in one session by simply pressing the STOP Button in the app OR pressing the newly created hotkey for it: Ctrl+S
- Added a toggle to make the game windows not the top most windows. Useful if you want to use other programs in the background. Hotkey is Ctrl+A. Pressing it will either disable or enable the windows being top most, depending on its current state. This requires Game.GameName in Nucleus game scripts to work.

v0.9a - August 1, 2019
